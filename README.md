# Quizzler

## Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my experience working with the following technologies

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Git
- CI/CD: CircleCI
- GitOps: ArgoCD
- Monitoring - Prometheus/Grafanna
- Deployment - AWS

Since I have web/mobile development experience where your skill and work can be easily seen through projects you've built in the past. I find it really hard to prove that I am knowledgible and skilled in the technologies used in DevOps and Cloud computing. I hope this tiny project provides the necessary prove for that.

This project named **Quizzler** is small react project that users can take quizzes.

Most of the requirements of Quizzler is inspired from an interview I had with a company for a Junior DevOps Position.

While this project is basic in all ramifications, and in a real world scenario, I would be handling complex projects containing thousands of microservices. The goal is to demonstrate my understanding of DevOps and its related skills.

### Requirements of Quizzler

- Quizzler should be deployable in different data centers exposed to the internet with different URLs

- The deployment should be packaged in such a way so that is fully compatible with a modern CI/CD tool e.g. ArgoCD, Flux, GitLab, Jenkins, Harness, Spinnaker

- During deployment, the user should experience zero downtime

- The deployment should have the ability to rollback if needed

- There should be an automated recovery in case of failure

#### Environment

- Node 12+

#### How to run

- first run `npm i` to install all dependencies
- Then run `npm run start` to start the project.

#### How to test

- Run `npm run test` to start the test runner

#### How to read and my solution to the requirements

There's a solution.md file in the root directory of the project that gives a detailed description of each technology used, the justification if needed and my approach to satisfying the requirements listed above.
